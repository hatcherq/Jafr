# Jafr

Jafr is designed to run whenever a user opens their terminal at the beginning of their day. Users can choose to view reminders that are relevant to the current day, or make changes. Changes can include sharing reminders with other users.

There are two kinds of reminders: tasks and meetings.

Jafr is Unix-friendly. This means that

1. Users interact with Jafr by typing commands in a command-line interface.

2. Jafr assumes that all the tasks and meetings are stored in text files that are otherwise managed by users of the shared system. Users simply edit these files themselves when they want to make changes outside of Jafr..
